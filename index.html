                         We took a survey, and the results we reciveed found out that almost half of the teens
                         particpating in filling the survey, had no hobby, or didn't have any specific activities they enjoyed.
                         We belive that hobbies are very crucial because they give us something to do in our spare time, and they
                         improve our wellbeing, because we are doing things that we enjoy.
